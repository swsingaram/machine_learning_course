Hi Walter
It seems that Sunday after 5 and Wednesday after 6 are the times Dikla is free.
Tuesday afternoon we are with Yoram's kids in Zur Hadassah, Monday is no good for Dikla and Thursday+Friday she has some kind of a conference.  Sunday is best.
Please let me know.
Avinoam
PS. I am free all  mornings, Dikla is not
